About: This app allows you to play a game of battleship against the Platform 45
        Battleship server.  The game starts with you entering your name/email,
        followed by setting up your ships on the playing board, followed by
        actually playing the game.  You go first, by clicking on an enemy square
        that you'd like to fire upon.  The firing is then processed, the results
        displayed, and then it's your turn to get fired UPON. After those
        results are displayed, it's your turn to fire again.  The game goes
        on like this until somebody wins/loses. 

Note: This game can be played against the Platform 45 Server or against it's
      own internal enemy. You can change who you are playing against 
      by setting session[:p45_WORKING] to true or false at the top of the 
      game_controller.rb file.
