<%# Assuming P45 server is fixed and X,Y Coords get sent, need to update
    board, stats, etc with P45's firing. %>
<%# first turn x-y coords into an index that can be used to select
    the appropriate 'target' element %>
 $index = <%= @yCoord * 10 + @xCoord %>;

<%# Now must determine if this is going to be a 'hit' or 'miss'
    1 - Determine if ship is occupying this spot
    2 - If not, board doesn't have to be updated
      a - Can add message saying X,Y is a miss!, update stats?
    3 - If hit, then mark ship as hit - Does P45 get an update on this????
      a - update stats, check if game over
    4 - If game not over, then it's my turn to fire a missile %>

<%# This is how you would select an enemy target. Use '.ship' to select my ship
    but will have to figure out something other than .eq() since not all 
    squares on the board have a ship (unlike the enemy board, where all 
      squares have targets...)  %>
$('.target').eq(10).addClass("hit"); 



<%# Game then turns to me, allowing me to pick a target, which will 
    generate a nuke request, with a response of hit/miss/etc 
    appropriate game stats need to be updated %>

<%# P45 will then fire again (I assume without need for prompt?) 
    and thus this loop continues until end of game...  %>
